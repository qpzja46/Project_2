# Find Your Pet!

Create an app that allowed users the ability to more easily search Craigslist for a pet to adopt/purchase

Goal
------
To help future pet owners find their perfect pet, we’ve designed an app that will scrape the Craigslist app and return pets meeting their search requirements (type of pet and location)

The Process of Creating Our App
------
1. Design a web scraper to scrape Craigslist’s pet section
2. Use flask and MongoDB to populate a database with the data we scraped
3. Use HTML and CSS to design a website 
4. Use JavaScript to create functioning buttons on the website and filter results to display pets that fit the user’s criteria 

Data Source
------
Our data source folder contains scraped data and zipcode information
The scraped data is in a Json file and includes all the items we scraped: title, description, image URLs, main URL, location coordinates
The zipcode csv matches zipcode and latitude/longitude
