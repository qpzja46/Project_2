We're expecting in a few months and don't think we can give her the attention and time she needs. We adopted her from a foster home, she's approximately 3 month old - spayed and has all her vaccinations (for being kept indoors). She's low maintenance, self grooms, and we've had no litter \"accidents\" since adopting her. She's very social around everyone including strangers, but she needs a lot of attention. She loves to play and Shih tzu Puppies typically don't like to be left alone for long periods of time. We'd like to give her to a home where she wouldn't be alone for 8+hrs a day - we believe she should ideally be taken into a multi-Pupps home where she can have a friend to play with.

Make sure the organization has a no-kill philosophy. Read as many reviews of various organizations as possible and check their websites. Some rescues/shelters don't have websites, I consider that a red flag. Some rescues/shelters are so particular about to whom they adopt out their animals, it's easier to adopt a child. Look at the fees the organization is charging for their pets. Many of them charge almost as much as a reputable breeder which makes it difficult for them to adopt out your pet, so the animal may not live in a permanent home for months. Try to get a referral from people you know who have had experiences with various rescues/shelters.

As the years passed by they took more and more animals each year. Some were bought and some were brought and now the refuge is a safe haven for almost 100 permanent residents. The permanent residence at PCC consists of animals that were unwanted or neglected by agencies/people and indigenous and non-indigenous wild animals that have been captive breed. The Uhters enjoyed caring for their animals so much, they decided to start helping wildlife as well. So, it was then that Paws Critter Crossing became a two-fold operation.\n\n In 1999 PCC was incorporated as a non-profit organization striving to keep the refuge open for community outreach and education and to rehabilitate and safely release orphaned, injured and displaced wildlife. All the animals that are at or brought to PCC are cared for and provided with veterinary treatment if needed. The rehabilitated wildlife animals are treated and released unless they are too weak to survive.\n\n Our work at PCC is provided entirely by volunteers and funded solely by public donations. We receive no financial assistance from any government organization or agency. So we reach out to you, the public, for any type of contribution you can provide, whether it is monetary, something from our wish list, or simply you coming out and volunteering your time and helping hands at PCC.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO WAIT FOR A REPLY, SIMPLY COME TO THE EVENT AND LET US KNOW YOU FILLED OUT A PRE-ADOPT ONLINE. \nhttp://www.asap-usa.org/adopt-a-kitty-1.html\n\nAll our cats have been spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and virus tested. The microchip registration fee is prepaid on most of our adoptable cats. They also come with small bags of food and litter. If you have a cat carrier bring it with you so you have a secure way to transport your new kitty. A short application and adoption donation will apply. You can speed up the process by filling out the pre-adopt form on our website (no need to wait for a reply-fill it out and come out to Farm & Fleet to meet the kitties). For details on adoption and the pre-adopt form visit http://asap-usa.org/site/Adopt_a_Kitty.html \n\nWe are a foster home based rescue. Call  show contact info\n during daytime hours to make an appointment to meet any of our kitties.\n\nEach cat and kitten that finds a new home this weekend gives us the space and resources to rescue another. Your adoption will help us save the life of the next homeless pet that comes our way!\n\nTo see our other adoptable kitties visit our petfinder page (not all will be at Farm & Fleet) http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/IL551.html\n\nIf you have questions please call us at  show contact info\n during business hours. (Please don't call  Pet Vet Animal Clinic, as we are simply their guests at adoption events - they don't have any information about our adoptable pets or our programs.)\n\nIf you can't come see us this weekend, visit with some of our adoptable kitties in our kitty condo at Pet Vet Animal Clinic in Huntley during their normal business hours ( http://petvetac.com/ ) , or view all of our adoptable pets online at http://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?shelter_id=IL551\n\nFor more information about A.S.A.P. visit our website: http://asap-usa.org/site/Our_Services.html\n\n\n***ADOPT*** VOLUNTEER*** FOSTER*** DONATE***\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAnimal Services and Assistance Programs (ASAP) is a non-profit organization based in Marengo. Many of the cats we have available for adoption are part of our Trap-Neuter-Return Program, and were once owned and abandoned (or are kittens born to an abandoned mother cat). They live in a home environment; we'd love to help you select the cat or kitten that best suits your lifestyle. Most of our cats do well with other cats, dogs and children.\n\nInterested in helping us save more lives? We need more foster families to help socialize kittens for a few weeks, getting them ready for adoption. Call us at  show contact info\n for more information or to participate!\n\nHave unowned cats around your neighborhood? Talk to us about low-cost spay/neuter options for those community cats so they don't have little ones.

As the years passed by they took more and more animals each year. Some were bought and some were brought and now the refuge is a safe haven for almost 100 permanent residents. The permanent residence at PCC consists of animals that were unwanted or neglected by agencies/people and indigenous and non-indigenous wild animals that have been captive breed. The Uhters enjoyed caring for their animals so much, they decided to start helping wildlife as well. So, it was then that Paws Critter Crossing became a two-fold operation.\n\n In 1999 PCC was incorporated as a non-profit organization striving to keep the refuge open for community outreach and education and to rehabilitate and safely release orphaned, injured and displaced wildlife. All the animals that are at or brought to PCC are cared for and provided with veterinary treatment if needed. The rehabilitated wildlife animals are treated and released unless they are too weak to survive.\n\n Our work at PCC is provided entirely by volunteers and funded solely by public donations. We receive no financial assistance from any government organization or agency. So we reach out to you, the public, for any type of contribution you can provide, whether it is monetary, something from our wish list, or simply you coming out and volunteering your time and helping hands at PCC.

One Monday, we went out on the grass and then I told her and her buddy Ziggy to get inside.A couple days before she returned, I put food out in a dish on the patio and noticed it had been half eaten. I had left food out when the gate was open and caught dogs eating it late at night but now the gate was closed so I wondered, who ate it?I came downstairs around midnight on day 19 and every day since she had been gone I'd look outside at the patio hoping she would be there. I immediately looked at the dish and the food was gone and as I turned my head, there she was on the patio.I opened the door slowly and she would not stop meowing. She came inside and meowed all night. I think she was telling us all about her adventure or what she had experienced. She was thinner but completely clean and not a scratch on her.PawMaw gave me the peace of mind that there were others out there helping to locate her. In today's world of social media and information, it just takes one person to see her and call and PawMaw gave me hope.\"    ","coordinates":["41.861379","-87.687378"],"craiglist_url":"https://chicago.craigslist.org/chc/pet/d/chicago-recover-your-missing-pet-via/6915132642.html","time_posted":"2019-06-18T17:15:45-0500"}

When he arrived, Bubba tested positive for heartworm and Ehrlichia (from ticks), and he has been successfully treated for both and is doing great in a foster home. His tail never stops wagging, and his coat is so soft! He is so happy, and everything is awesome when he’s around. Bubba is playful and friendly with the older dogs his size in the foster home, so he will need a tolerant playmate who can give a gentle correction if he gets too rowdy. He prefers the company of female furfriends. He listens well and will come when called. He prefers to dine alone without other dogs seeing what’s in his bowl, but he’s fine with people. As expected, he barks at the little yappy dog on the other side of the fence. He might be too much excitement for a dog park, but he’s happy to play in a yard or go on a walk. When he’s not playing, he also likes cuddles and affection. His foster mom says Bubba is good in his crate for a regular work day, but he will bark at other dogs when he’s contained and they are not. He is too interested in the kitties in the foster home, but they are safe in another area. We are unaware of history with kids, but he is so sweet and friendly that he can live with kids 10 and up who don’t mind him trying to hug them. Bubba has already mastered sit and down, and he is eager to learn more. He’s a little enthusiastic for the first minute he meets you, but it’s all adorable affection. He loves a good butt scratch. Bubba quiets down in his crate quickly and loves snuggles anyone he meets! His favorite toys are bubbles, a bone full of peanut butter, and Benebones.\n\n\nBecause we are all volunteers, Illinois Doberman Rescue Plus only considers approved applicants to meet our orphans in our foster homes.

He seems like he would get along with a laid back dog with very slow introductions, but is probably best as an only dog.  Once you earn Griffey’s trust, he is a total smushy lovebug and wants nothing more than to be loved and hang out with you! He does okay with a regular workday but would be best if he had someone to let him outside every few hours. Griffey will likely never be the guy you can walk down the street or leave roaming at a party meeting new people instantly because of his initial fearfulness of strangers. While Griffey is making some progress, he will need to be enrolled in obedience training with a positive reinforcement protocol to continue to boost his confidence. He also needs to continue learning the feeling of safety with new things and people. Griffey knows his basic commands such as sit, stay, off, leave it, paw, come, and touch (to focus his attention). Sweet Griffey really wants nothing more than to be loved and to please his human.  He is a gorgeous boy who gets the zoomies on occasion and is absolutely adorable while bounding around the yard. He LOVES toys and is good at not de-stuffing them immediately! He often carries his favorite stuffed animal with him! Griffey requires a fenced in yard (no e-fence). Griffey needs to be placed with an experienced owner who understands the importance of taking the time to work with Griffey as he learns to trust others and flourish as a wonderful companion. He is recommended for an adult only household and cannot be placed with cats.\n\nBecause we are all volunteers, Illinois Doberman Rescue Plus only considers approved applicants to meet our orphans in our foster homes.

In her temporary foster home, Maggie showed us that she is very loving and gentle. She adapted quickly to her new foster home and is very friendly with adults and kids of all ages, however large breed experience is preferred especially with smaller children. She is fully house-trained as well as crate-trained. She is also very food driven, so she has been easy to train. Maggie does need to be an only animal. The Great Danes are known for their high prey drive, so this is not uncommon. She has shown us that she does not appreciate other dogs, cats, and small animals at a distance, but she loves to be near her people. She requires only moderate activity because she was very laid back with her foster parents. She walks well on a leash but will pull when she sees other dogs. Because of her size and prey drive, she is required to go to a home with a privacy fence that is at least 6 feet tall. Maggie absolutely loves afternoon car rides and does really well with baths and having her nails clipped. Obedience classes are required because of her size and to encourage bonding. She loves to obey and please, so she has a great foundation for learning. When Maggie arrived at IDR+, there was some bone exposed on her tail, most likely from having “happy tail.” We have it wrapped so that she will not further injure her tail. Once it fully heals, she should have no further issues. She could also stand to gain some healthy weight, and will probably round out at about 100-110 pounds. She loves to lean against her person and give kisses. She is so smart and loving and can’t wait to be your loyal companion!\n\nBecause we are all volunteers, Illinois Doberman Rescue Plus only considers approved applicants to meet our orphans in our foster homes.

He was picked up at large in the southern area of Illinois and was discovered to have a microchip. When the owner was contacted, they stated that they gave Arlo away to someone else, and they did not want him back. He is now safely in our program and fully vetted. It was discovered that Arlo lived with his littermate for some time, so he is said to be good with dogs, but would be best placed with another large breed dog. He has an unknown history with cats. Seeing as he has been on the lam a couple of times already, he has a 6-foot fencing requirement to make sure he stays secure in his yard. Arlo is a big boy but needs to gain some healthy weight, and will probably round out around 120-130 pounds — so you can expect a large Dane! Due to his size, he is recommended for older children 12 & up, who know how to behave correctly around large breed dogs.\n\nArlo is a sweet boy that is a little nervous of new people but warms up very quickly for treats. He does best with new people when they give him his own space and allow him to approach for a cookie. He takes them very gently from your hands and then he is all yours! Arlo enjoys ear rubs and pats on his sides. During his photo session, he was very happy to sit and give paw for treats, so he has a good foundation for further learning. He has the signature prance of a Great Dane when he is happy, and enjoys stuffies to walk around with. Arlo is staying at a nice boarding facility, and not yet in a foster home, so we are still getting to know his habits. Due to his previous propensity to run away, he would benefit from an experienced Dane or giant breed owner that can teach him the ropes to basic obedience and remain consistent. He also has a basic obedience requirement deposit, so his new adopters should expect and be prepared to take him to an obedience class within six months of adoption. This will help strengthen the bond with Arlo, as well as increase his social skills. Overall, Arlo is a joy to be around and just wants to be the over-sized lap dog he’s meant to be!\n\nBecause we are all volunteers, Illinois Doberman Rescue Plus only considers approved applicants to meet our orphans in our foster homes.

He isn’t your typical pet dog, this young guy is high drive and will do almost anything you ask as long as a ball in involved.  He has improved with his treat training, but lets be honest he would prefer a BALL, and who are we to deny the guy his number one motivator.  Not only is he high drive but man is he handsome, just check out those satellites for ears.  Hunk has many many wonderful qualities such as he crates beautifully in the house, in the car, in new environments, he doesn’t care where he is crated or what commotion is going on around him he is fine to just chill.  He will kennel on cue and knows a few other basic behaviors as well.  He is good at sit, down, drop, name recognition, spin left, spin right and wait.  He has also learned to jump through a hoop and will jump over it at any height.  He would make an AMAZING sport or working dog.  Don’t limit your options either, this guy can jump, run, sniff, swim, you name it he can do it.  He would be great at agility, dock diving, schutzhund, nosework, honestly anything, but those are the things we have tried him with.  We took him dock diving one time and then he realized he is obsessed with swimming and now if there is a body of water we cannot keep him out of it.  Other endearing qualities of Hunk are that he isn’t fearful of anything and will work in any setting, he isn’t phased by the commotion of people or other dogs around him he just continues to do his thing.  He is happy to go to new places and isn’t nervous to be away from home.  Sounds do not bother him either, this dog is bomb proof.  He loves to run, if you are a runner this could be your guy, he has a lot of practice pulling a skateboard and running on our dog powered treadmill as well.  This guy is also great off leash, and has decent on leash skills as well.  If you’re looking to add a new active dog to your home, this is your guy!

They did not realize until their female became pregnant and gave birth to this litter. The people who gave the rats to us did a very good job of socializing them and they are all tame and friendly. Although I do not know much about their genetic history, they do appear quite healthy and have glossy soft fur. They all inherited very similar hooded fur patterns and are top-eared, non-rex. They were born on 4/13/19. Since these rats are of unknown origin, we are only asking a $5 adoption fee per animal.\n\nIn order to ensure that they go to a good home,  we will ask you to fill out a short questionnaire (7 questions).

Will consider rehoming with or without her cage - she is NOT free and fee to be discussed with the right home.\n\nFemale b&g macaw. Semi tame and will need more handling for a pet but has potential.
